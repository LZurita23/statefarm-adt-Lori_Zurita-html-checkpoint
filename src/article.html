        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="../HTML/images/Lori Zurita1.jpg" alt="Lori" width="175" height="150">

        <p>My name is Lori Zurita. I am a Texas girl raise in Odessa, TX. I married my Junior High sweetheart, David. We have three children, two boys and a girl.</p>

        <p>I was raised in a single parent household. My mom had to learn to do things for herself and I believe I inherited her "can do attitude". My father was a "Jack of All Trades" kind of guy. I believe I inherited that from him as I love doing so many different things and find I am good at many.</p>

        <p>I see a job around the house or a repair to my car and I want it done right away and truth be told I really love fixing things. I am a troubleshooter at home and at work. I love figuring out the solutions to most any problem. I don't mind getting my hands dirty. I even like working on cars.</p>

        <p>In my youth, growing up as a young single mom I purchased my own car and found that it needed lots of love and lots of repairs. When I would take it to get it looked at and get an estimate I would notice how much it would cost of a small part and then the large fee I would pay for the labor. I thought to myself, "maybe I can do it?" and I am so glad I did. I was able to fix so many things on that car. I replaced belts, changed the oil, replace the brake pads, and even replaced the alternator. I saved myself so much money.</p>

        <p>I have thought about starting a handywoman business because I had heard from so many female co-workers,especially the single ones, how nice it would be to have a woman to do handyperson jobs for them. The jobs which can be seen as very simple, but these women do not feel comfortable doing for themselves and they were also worried and uncomfortable every time they have to invite a strange man into their homes to repair something. I thought since I love repairing my vehicle and doing things around the house it might not be that bad.</p>
