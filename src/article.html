                <p>I was raised in a single parent household. My mom had to learn to do things for herself and I believe I inherited her "can do attitude". My father was a "Jack of All Trades" kind of guy. I believe I inherited that from him as I love doing so many different things and find I am good at many of the things I try.</p>

                <p>I see a job around the house or a repair needed for my car and I want it done right away. Truth be told, I really love fixing things. I am a troubleshooter at home and at work. I love figuring out the solution to most any problem. I don't mind getting my hands dirty.</p>

                <p>In my youth, I purchased my own car and found that it needed lots of love and lots of repairs. When I would take it to get an estimate I would notice how much the cost for a small part was and then the large fee for the labor. I thought to myself, "maybe I can do it?" and I am so glad I did. I was able to fix so many things on that car. I replaced belts, changed the oil, replace the brake pads, and even replaced the alternator. I saved myself so much money.</p>

                <p>I have thought about starting a handywoman business because I had heard from so many female co-workers,especially the single ones, how nice it would be to have a woman to do small jobs for them. Some jobs can be seen as very simple, but the women I spoke to did not feel comfortable doing things for themselves. The women I spoke to also said they would worry and feel uncomfortable when they had to invite a strange man into their homes to repair something. I thought since I love repairing my vehicle and doing things around the house it might not be that bad.</p>
